0,Adrian Mitchell,"To whom it may concern --

My name is Adrian Mitchell, and I believe that I would be an excellent fit for the role of Accounts Payable Specialist at Rookieplay. As someone who has held down a wide variety of accounts payable roles, I have the experience, versatility, and drive to be a valuable member of Rookieplay's continued operations.

My number of jobs have prepared me for a variety of financial software systems as well as a wide variety of workloads. My very first position -- at Digitas -- threw me right into the fire as they were working on fiscal year-end close and 1099 season. I had never worked in finance before then, and I picked up not only the software they used (Lawson) but also the specifics of the job, of monthly and year-end closes, and how to correctly make and distribute 1099s. Since then, I have come into many environments with that knowledge of how to improve processes and ensure IRS compliance for tax season. My roles at BellXcel, the New England Historic Genealogical Society, and From the Top, especially, prepared me to be a one-woman AP team. I work well on a team, though, especially with ample communication; my role at Mintz Levin was my highest volume and thus required multiple people working on AP and communication of what was required, with me being in charge of international invoices along with both domestic and international vendor management.

As such, I have worked with many different pieces of financial software over the years, from Quickbooks to Microsoft Dynamics GP to Oracle to Lawson to Chrome River to Financial Edge and so on. My versatility allows me to adapt to programs and how they flow/function easily, and I am always wanting to learn and execute on new things. This allows me to adapt well, to smile and be warm even when things are stressful.

Thank you for your time. My contact information should be available on my resume if you wish to follow up with me.

Kindest regards,

--Adrian Mitchell"

Hello RookiePlay, 
I recently saw your posting on Indeed in regards to your need for an accounts payable specialist, and I’m salivating at the chance to show you what I can do! It also could be due to this juice cleanse I’m trying...I’m not sure yet. 
Who is she: a charismatic math-lete. Although my most recent work experience has been within the dental field, I am looking to jump back into the analytical accounting lagoon. 
Repeat after me: multitasking! Managing the front desk (and eventually the office) of a dental practice, put my problem-solving skills on the map. Prioritizing what I had to get done immediately, what I can email in an hour, and what I have to call about tomorrow, is the epitome of my workload. 
Our favorite thing: numbers. Your time is precious, and so is mine. I think it’s great to discuss salary right away. I’m currently requesting a salary between $58,000 and $61,000. 
What’s included: my resume! It details the qualifications in which I believe that amount is justified. 
Thank you very much for your time! Please let me know if you have any questions. However, if you want to know how the juice cleanse went, give me a few days. Jury’s still out on that one. 
Thank you,

I am writing to express my interest in your available position as Accounts Payable Specialist. I currently work for State Farm Insurance as a licensed agent, selling and servicing Property & Casualty and Life, Health & Disability insurance. Previous to this I worked as a Claims Supervisor for the Shasta County District Attorney’s Office and the California Victim Compensation Board. This position required me to possess the ability to determine whether claims are eligible and compliant with all stated regulations and required the strictest confidentiality measures. I supervised a staff tasked with determining benefits, such as medical payments, income loss, relocation, and funeral expenses. It was crucial to review all claims to ensure no other sources of payment were eligible for the same entitlement, such as medical insurance, auto insurance or workers compensation. I audited all payments before they were released to ensure no duplication of payment was being made, as this program was a payer of last resort.
Prior to my Claims Supervisor position, I was the Regional Manager of several H&R Block Franchise offices. I supervised 45 staff in 6 remote offices. I audited and advocated for clients with IRS, Franchise Tax Board, and HRB Bank when there were refund issues. This required learning the client’s circumstance and contacting the appropriate government agency or bank for resolution. As the regional manager I was responsible for accuracy, office audits, training, customer service and quality assurance.
I have represented the organizations that I have worked for with commitment and pride. I am self motivated with excellent communication, time management, and organizational skills. I have a true compassion for people and posses a positive attitude. I feel the combination of my education and gained experience throughout my career would make me a valued team member.
Recently my husband accepted an amazing job, so we now live in far Northern California in the beautiful Klamath Mountain ranges of Trinity County. There is reduced opportunity for me in this area due to how rural it is, thus I am looking to work remotely. Though it is a rural area we have very reliable internet.

I can train your staff, enter and process invoices, all virtually, or visit the office as needed. It seems you have a PO process in place, which is wonderful but needs oversight. I can do all that for you. I have 25 years experience. Best of all I prefer to be a 1099, therefore save you money in benefits, taxes, and charge a monthly flat fee that is well below what this annualized salary is. Depending on volume and systems, my rate would be around $4k per month.

I would like to hear more if this sounds interesting to you.

I can be reached at 815-768-6398.

Sincerely,


Holli Washburn"

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am responding to the Operations Coordinator position posted on Indeed.  My experience working for a medical staffing agency and my education from Northern Illinois University have given me knowledge and skills that I will be able to apply to this position. 

Throughout my time at Ro Health, I have worked in multiple roles within the company which allowed me to be involved with many aspects of the organization. In my current role as Senior Payroll and Billing Coordinator I am responsible for all internal employees in the Finance Department. This has giving me experience with training and onboarding employees. I oversee payroll for all contract and internal employees. This included multistate payroll in California, Oregon, Washington, Arizona, Colorado and Texas. This has given me experience in handling many aspects of the payroll process including employee commissions, and garnishments. I also created and implemented a database used for tracking employee benefit selections and deductions. This allowed Human Resources and Finance team members to communicate and track benefits. 

Along with payroll and benefits, ensuring all invoices and billing information is sent promptly to 105 clients is another area of focus. In this position I assist the CEO in quarterly financial forecasting, and lead weekly Accounts Receivable meetings. This has allowed me to interact with managers and personal in all levels of the organization.

I started my career at Ro Health as a Staffing Consultant with an emphasis in recruiting Oregon state. Within 4 months I was promoted to Manager of the Oregon branch. This included recruiting, onboarding, and managing all employees in the Northwest region. Along with managing employees, securing and negotiating contracts was an important part of this position. 

During my lasts semester at Northern Illinois University I interned at American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network (ACS CAN). While interning at ACS CAN I secured and managed donations for four fundraising events for the Sacramento division. After taking over all marketing for the fundraisers, I was able to secure 5,000 more dollars of donations than the previous year. Along with fundraising, assisting in research for lobbyist before meetings with state representatives is another skill, I was able to learn during my time in this role.  

Currently, I am seeking an opportunity that will allow me to relocate to Illinois.  I would be eager to apply my skills and knowledge in this position. Thank you for your time and consideration. 

Sincerely, 

Megan Kennell

","I currently attend Loyola University and am majoring in Business Management. I would love to work in an environment where I can demonstrate what I’ve learned and continue to grow in my studies.

In my current position, I am responsible for developing treatment plans with patients. I explain their financial obligations and payment options. I also collect incoming payments from patients as well as process pre-authorizations and incoming payments received from insurance companies. I have also helped to increase productivity in my office tremendously.

I began my journey with Madison-Pine Dental Clinic over fifteen years ago. At that time, we serviced an average of twenty-five patients per day throughout the week and about ten patients on Saturdays. My task was simply to verifying insurances and sending pre-authorizations to Medicaid. Although I had no dental experience, I quickly acquired the knowledge and terminology to become an integral employee. We now serve over forty-five patients a day throughout the week and roughly twenty-five patients on Saturdays.
Of course, I am not totally responsible for this tremendous growth of patients, we have an amazing staff, a great hygienist, and very talented doctors. I have learned to be a listening ear for a mother who has struggled tirelessly to convince her child that good dental hygiene will lead to good health. I have patiently listened to stories from elderly patients about how he/she walked five miles to school and would wake up at 2 a.m., you know how the story goes. I have also smiled with excitement at a child who has told me her dreams of becoming a lawyer.
I have created memories with Madison-Pine Dental throughout these fifteen years. I have learned that patience, understanding, and communication is key for a successful customer-oriented business.
I would like the opportunity to interview for a position and talk with you to learn more about your opportunities and hiring plans. I would like to thank you for your consideration and look forward to hearing from you soon."

What you won't know about me is that I am a driven and self-motivated individual who thrives to achieve success both at work and in my personal life.
Without parents' help, I managed to finance my education and even have enough resources to start investing. It all wouldn't be possible without courage and time-management. The time-management is something I am proud to be good at. Working full time, plus full-time school with the HW on the side is not an easy task, but that's what made me fully understand how to be in control of everything life brings.
I have had a lot of little jobs through the teenage time but the most recent and one I truly enjoyed was serving. The restaurant business is super diverse with the non-stop traffic of all types of customers. It made me improve people skills, money handling, problem-solving techniques, and taught me to be on top of everything to make sure everyone leaves happy. Choosing such a job brought the opportunity to work in a fast-paced environment, and the ability to be a part of a team.
As an honors student in finance, I have completed upper-division coursework in managerial finance, quantitative methods, investments, and data analysis that has provided me with a business understanding of market strategies and technologies. It gave me enough knowledge and confidence to be ready to enter the finance job market.
