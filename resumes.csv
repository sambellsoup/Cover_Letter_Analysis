252,Parris Fleurival," Parris FleurivalNew York, NYparrisfleurival3_vrt@indeedemail.com9144260741Growing up in the digital age social media has always been like second nature for me. I rememberstarting from the using Instant messenger to Tumblr to now all the major platforms that we use today.It has been a vital part of my life and something that I use every single day and is very important tome ""staying in the know"" with brands, fashion, music and pop culture are not only a part of my life butwhat I am passionate the most about. The passion grew into a love for communications and marketingthat I think would not have been possible without my knowledge or social media. This has led me tomany great opportunities like an internship at Walt Disney World and be able to have an opportunity in my field before graduating college. Thought my years of college at SUNY Buffalo State and my last year at SUNY Oswego the passion Ihave for all this media grew with the more education I acquired about the many aspects of my field. Learning about analytics, trends in the market and target audiences as well as laws pertaining tomedia grew my fascination but also showed me I have a lot more to learn. So now, as my college years come to an end, the passion is still within me. With all the knowledge Ihave learned and in an industry that will certainly not look the same in 10 years, all I have left to learn.And for that I am truly grateful.Authorized to work in the US for any employerWork ExperienceMarketing CoordinatorBingley DigitalNovember 2019 to PresentState University of New York CollegeOswego - Oswego, NYJanuary 2019 to PresentOswego, New York Area  Mass Media & The Law Social Networks and The Web Media Copywriting Media EconomicsActive MemberSigma Delta Tau - Town of Niagara, NYMarch 2016 to PresentAreaInternshipThe Walt Disney Company - Orlando, FLJanuary 2019 to May 2019Area  Provide guests with menus. Greet guests and seat them at tables or in waiting areas. Assign patrons to tables suitable for their needs and according to rotation so that servers receive anappropriate number of seatings. Speak with patrons to ensure satisfaction with food and service, to respond to complaints, or to makeconversation.Editor In ChiefThe Odyssey OnlineMay 2018 to January 2019Choose subject matter and suitable form to express personal feelings and experiences or ideas, or tonarrate stories or events. Plan project arrangements or outlines, and organize material accordingly. Prepare works in an appropriate format for publication, and send them to publishers or producers. Revise written material to meet personal standards and to satisfy the needs of clients, publishers,directors, or producers. Follow appropriate procedures to get copyrights for completed work.EducationBachelor's degree in Communication and Media StudiesSUNY Oswego2019 to 2020Bachelor's degree in Public RelationsState University of New York College2016 to 2018Skills• Customer ServiceMicrosoft OfficeMicrosoft Word• Digital Marketing• Email Marketing• Social Media• Photoshop• Email• Adobe• IndesignLinkshttps://www.linkedin.com/in/parris-fleurival-58b733137https://www.linkedin.com/in/parris-fleurival-58b733137?jobid=1234&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_jobs_easyapplygenresume%3BDdA3hiznQXyjhnS6EeLWyg%3D%3D&licu=urn%3Ali%3Acontrol%3Ad_jobs_easyapplygenresume-v02_profileAssessmentsCustomer Focus & Orientation — Highly ProficientMarch 2020Responding to customer situations with sensitivity.Full results: https://share.indeedassessments.com/attempts/324e6427b90999bc7774379833b5f2c2eed53dc074545cb7 Assessments provides skills tests that are not indicative of a license or certification, or continueddevelopment in any professional field.https://www.linkedin.com/in/parris-fleurival-58b733137https://www.linkedin.com/in/parris-fleurival-58b733137?jobid=1234&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_jobs_easyapplygenresume%3BDdA3hiznQXyjhnS6EeLWyg%3D%3D&licu=urn%3Ali%3Acontrol%3Ad_jobs_easyapplygenresume-v02_profilehttps://www.linkedin.com/in/parris-fleurival-58b733137?jobid=1234&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_jobs_easyapplygenresume%3BDdA3hiznQXyjhnS6EeLWyg%3D%3D&licu=urn%3Ali%3Acontrol%3Ad_jobs_easyapplygenresume-v02_profilehttps://www.linkedin.com/in/parris-fleurival-58b733137?jobid=1234&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_jobs_easyapplygenresume%3BDdA3hiznQXyjhnS6EeLWyg%3D%3D&licu=urn%3Ali%3Acontrol%3Ad_jobs_easyapplygenresume-v02_profilehttps://share.indeedassessments.com/attempts/324e6427b90999bc7774379833b5f2c2eed53dc074545cb7https://share.indeedassessments.com/attempts/324e6427b90999bc7774379833b5f2c2eed53dc074545cb7"

322,Vickent Vera," Vickent VeraVideo Production | Video Editor | PhotographerNew York, NYvickentvera7_2tf@indeedemail.com(917) 391-8411I was born in Queens, NY. Both my parents come from the fourth most populated city in Ecuadorcalled Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas. They moved to New York in the 90’s with my sister who was 2years old, then they had me. During that time my dad was working in re-upholstery and my mom waslearning English at a school in Elmhurst (my dad is still an upholsterer but my mom now teaches PreK).  They took us to Disney World when I was only 4. We went on the Snow White ride and my dad scaredme when we got to the evil witch part and I cried. I cried anywhere I went to be honest.  My sister and I would watch movies with our cousin and her dad. We watched Spider-Man 2 when itcame out. On the subway ride back from the theater I would think that Spider-Man was on top of thesubway crawling around trying to go home too.  Since my cousin and my sister were the oldest they would put on scary movies, they wanted me toleave them alone to do girl stuff but I wanted to hang out with them. So I sat and watched Nightmareon Elm Street with them and it psychologically broke me. We watched Maximum Overdrive and it gaveme the worst nightmare, like waking up sobbing in your own sweat nightmare.  I couldn’t sleep at night without having a blanket over my head, I remember the feeling of impendingdoom anytime my ear was exposed in the night. Then that impending doom crossed over to myeveryday life. I never felt comfortable because I thought something bad would happen to me and Istart panicking. Scary movies really fucked me up. It wasn’t until I saw how Final Destination 3 wasmade that I started to realize they weren’t actually . And then I started to watch the behind the scenesof every movie I’ve seen and I thought it was really cool how they make everything.  Fast forward to now and I’ve become an annoying movie snob and a horror junkie. There hasn’t beenany recent horror movies that have scared me as much as when I was younger, I really wish there wasa movie that would make me feel those same terrible feelings, but the only thing that makes me gointo anxiety ridden panic attacks is all the debt I’ve accumulated.Willing to relocate: AnywhereAuthorized to work in the US for any employerWork ExperienceFreelance Media Ingest EditorNY1 News - New York, NYJanuary 2020 to Present• Prioritize media based on immediate needs • Book Satellite and Fiber feeds when needed • Tune in satellite feeds using the CompuSat system • Select proper method of ingest • Tune in NY1 microwave trucks using the WesCam system • Ensure accuracy of media labeling • Notify media status when retrieving from archive • Ensure data attached to media is complete • Oversees the life cycle of media content • Deletes and retains content upon instruction • Saves all useable media into archive system • Makes certain all inbound video and audio meets quality standards by using a Vector Scope andWaveform.Freelance Audio Visual TechnicianCrew Call INC. - New York, NYJune 2018 to PresentShow Coordinator – Crew Leads  Widescreen Engineers (Spyder and Encore) Video Engineers/Shaders/Switchers Widescreen Video Projectionists Turbo/Playback Pro Tape Operators  Camera Operators – Hand Held and Long Lens  Camera Grips  Video Assistants  Audio Engineers  A2’s/Wireless Microphone Engineer  Audio Assists  Lighting Directors/Designers  Master Lighting Electricians  Follow Spot Operators  Lighting Assistants  Lead Scenic Technicians  Scenic Technicians  Audi Visual/Breakout Operators Audio Visual Floaters/Technicians Graphic Operators College AssistantQueens College Multimedia Commons - Flushing, NYSeptember 2018 to June 2019• Types letters, memoranda, charts, and similar materials. • Acts as cashier. • Assists in statistical or research activities.

Too many times, writers have their heads in books and the nuances of how a“semicolon could affect their piece.” I’m a people person. I grew up in a time where reporters focusedon the truth and how that truth affects people; and I can only hope that my work reflects such pursuit. Ihope that the best I could do in my field, is remember that our stories and the events of world do effectpeople; whether we know it or not.  Recommendations available upon request.  #readytoworkWilling to relocate: AnywhereAuthorized to work in the US for any employerWork ExperienceFreelance PhotographerSelf-Employed - Westerville, OHSeptember 2017 to PresentContracted on multiple occasions by Otterbein University’s Alumni Relations to provide photographiccoverage.
