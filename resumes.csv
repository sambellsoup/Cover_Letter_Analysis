I have also been a member of the psychology club and Black Student Union for the past two years. I have also been a member of community outreach programs such as the Mi Amigo program, where our main objective was to provide help to disadvantaged children within the Bridgeport school system. I am also a member of my mother’s outreach program, “Reader’s Become Leader’s”, where reading is promoted during the summer to encourage disadvantaged children in the Freeport, Long Island area to expand their vocabulary. This past summer I also worked in Stratford and various other beach locations along the Long Island Sound as a member of Project Limulus. Project Limulus was also another community outreach program, that focused on nature conservation and community education. Rather than rest my senior year like many other people decide to do, I continued to take part in research capstones, which eventually payed off. During my spring semester, my research group received the Dean of the college of Arts and Sciences award for best research poster and the Provost’s award for best research poster among all other colleges.

118,Margaret Lily Stinstrom,"Hiring Manager RookiePlay  Margaret L. Stinstrom Sherman Oaks, CA 91413  Dear Hiring Manager,  My name is Margaret Lily Stinstrom. I am a recent graduate of The Ohio State University where I earned my Bachelor of Science in Psychology with a minor in Classics.  I found your Research Assistant position through . I greatly admire how your company seeks to provide consultation services to those who are looking for meaningful and attainable careers. I would love to be able to use my skills positively while learning from a team such as yours.  When I was an undergraduate research assistant for Communications, Psychology, and Emergency Medicine, I supported the research of multiple laboratories. In Emergency Medicine, I maintained the environment and inventory of the lab and assisted in experimental procedures. Additionally, I had the opportunity to read their published articles which allowed me to learn how to write reports more efficiently. I am capable of summarizing data and presenting the implications of the results to a wide range of audiences. I presented Dr. Chen’s Emergency Medicine Research at the annual Denman Undergraduate Research Forum where my audience consisted of professors and students of unrelated fields. My presentation was given favorable reviews.  While I was a psychology research assistant, I interacted with volunteers in a chat room setting in order to observe their responses to different cyberbullying scenarios. I also entered data on Cyberbullying news articles in an Excel file in order to eventually create an inter-rater reliability scale.  As an independent contractor, I work with a cloud-based platform with databases with large amounts of data. My tasks include performing extensive internet research on a wide variety of topics, data entry and verification, and transcribing audio files.  I have always been a strong supporter of community service especially for the sciences. As President of Women in Math and Science, I organized events to mentor underprivileged elementary school girls and the Girl Scouts using fun math and science workshops that were appropriate for their grade level. These workshop events helped the young girls maintain an interest in math and science and allowed my members to practice communicating their knowledge. At the same time, I was communicating with female professionals in order to procure speakers for our monthly Speaker Luncheon Series which allowed my members to interact with the professionals in a small group setting in order to discuss their journeys and careers. At the end of the year, my members expressed satisfaction and enjoyment with the monthly speaker series.  Furthermore, I was also a member of Alpha Phi Omega. As a member, I assisted in supporting underprivileged communities through activities such as sewing clothing, painting houses, sorting food at the foodbank, or as a volunteer staff member at events.  I believe that my experiences in research and social outreach makes me a strong candidate to be a Research Assistant for RookiePlay.  I look forward to further discussing this opportunity. Please feel free to contact me at mlstinstrom@gmail.com or 714-803-4011. I appreciate the time taken to review and consider my application.  Thank you,  Margaret L.

Wereport the first observation of BP polaritons from optical phonon and magnon resonances in the very low frequency range, and describethe experimental requirements to generate BP at any point along the electromagnetic spectrum.Teachers AssistantThe City College of the City University of New YorkJune 2018 to July 2018lab instructor and graderInstitute of Ultrafast Spectroscopy and LasersAugust 2016 to July 2018Research Assistant Raman Spectroscopy: Worked with others on theoretical and experimental research on crystals, liquidsolutions, magnetic iron garnets and mono crystalline sucrose using Raman spectroscopy with different types of lasers as well as varying the orbital angular momentumand polarization of the light coming out from the laser, analyzing the behavior of these molecules.In order to do any data analysis of each Raman plot with varying orbital angular momentum andpolarization of the light, the combination of Matlab and Originlab were significantly needed. The Matlab program was used to subtract the Ramanplots from the background and/or noise, thus to obtain normalized Raman plots. Respectively, Originlab was used to plot the Raman plots, label the peaks of the Raman plotsand compare Raman plots by placing them next to each other.Research AssistantInstitut für Technische Optik der Universität StuttgartMay 2015 to August 2016Holographic Imaging: Performed with others, theoretical and experimental research on holographicimaging through scattering media. Used Matlab program to produce the images of an object at severalplanes between the object and image planes of a 4f experimental setup with a scattering media at theFourier plane to explain that using Fourier transformation is ideal to produce the exact same image of the object behind scattering media. Thetechnique used by the Matlab program is similar to that of holographic imaging.Research AssistantInstitute of Ultrafast Spectroscopy and LasersOctober 2013 to April 2015Complex Light: Together with others used different types of laser beams consisting of varying theorbital angular momentum to measure the percent transmission through rat tissues and polystyrene bead samples, confirming that beams with higher orbital angular momentummodes transmits more light than those with lower modes. In order to produce the varying orbitalangular momentum modes, Matlab or Labview was needed, i.e. to create an L=0, L=1, L=4 and L=8Laguerre Gaussian beams. To do the data analysis, Matlab was needed to subtract the beam intensity peaks from the background and noise toobtain normalized beam intensity peaks.EducationMaster of Science (M.S.) in PhysicsThe City College of the City University of New York2016 to 2018Universität Stuttgart2015 to 2016Bachelor of Science in (B.S.), PhysicsThe City College of the City University of New York2008 to 2014Skills• Imaging• Matlab• Labview• Optical• Lasers• Spectroscopy• Optical design• C++• Excel• Microsoft office• Outlook• Powerpoint• WordAdditional InformationSkills: Labview, Microsoft Office (Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint and Word), Matlab, OriginLab, C++, VisibleSpectroscopy, Fluorescence Spectroscopy, Raman Spectroscopy, Medical Imaging, Holography, Lasers, Optical Design"

My experience ranges from call center handling, to data research and aggregation, tocustomer complaint handling as a department head, to content creation, to office organization, tomarketing strategy consultation, to social media management, to campaign launch strategy, tofundraising, to video production and editing, to general administrative assistance, to inbound callhandling and email composition, and finally, to recruiting, interviewing, hiring, and training newemployees. My background in Internet Marketing and my where-there’s-a-will-there’s-a-way mentalityallows me to bring a fresh approach to any task thrown my way.  As a former hiring manager, I know that hiring always comes down to distinguishing one person fromamong a throng of qualified and over-eager people.

I've held multiple telecommuting positionswith high level responsibility, tight deadlines, and demanding customer service interaction. I haveexcelled in each one. My determination to succeed and my 110% mindset have caused previous clientsand employers to highly value me, offering promotions and raises well before they would normally beexpected.  #readytoworkAuthorized to work in the US for any employerWork ExperienceExecutive Virtual Assistant & Marketing SpecialistSelf-employed -
