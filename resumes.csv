In any challenge, I strive to find the process between inspiration and execution exciting,efficient, and thorough — a mindset I value whether I’m scouting for innovative artists, creatingmarketing campaigns for a multi billion-dollar real estate brand, directing virtual reality assets, ordesigning my own clothing and furniture line. Since 2009, I have served as the co-founder and CEOfor Underwater Peoples Records, an independent record label which launched the careers of Billboardcharting artists such as Real Estate and Tennis. Through Underwater Peoples’ ground-up operation,I’ve been responsible for everything from A&R, marketing album campaigns, global distribution,accounting, event planning, booking live events, to providing creative counsel to our artists. Throughour efforts, Underwater Peoples was recognized by Billboard Magazine as one of the Top 50 indie musiclabels in America.  In addition to the label, I also write, perform, and produce my own music as Evan Ønly and FamilyPortrait. After negotiating a licensing deal from HBO for a Family Portrait song, I decided to start myown publishing company, Family Only Publishing. Today I have grown to license music to Lionsgate,The X Games, Ray-Ban, Maavven and more. Flavorwire recognized my work as an artist and musicentrepreneur by placing me in their Top 40 Culture Makers to Watch list in 2013. Alongside my passionprojects I have sought out a dynamic range of workplace experiences. Such as leading UGC socialmedia campaigns at Penske Media Corp. (PMC), to building a digital marketing initiative from theground-up creating virtual reality assets and directing the social media strategy at Time Equities, Inc.My ideal future balances the fusion of strategy and creativity, with innovation and commerce.

QUALIFICATIONS: As a former Senior On-Line Editor, General Manager and Vice President of Sales & Marketing, I offer a unique blend of production expertise and management experience. I’m as comfortable in an editing room/office environment or communicating on-line as I am in a conference room conducting a meeting before staff or prospective clients. WORK EXPERIENCE: 6/3/15 to Present…Ron Harris Productions Owner/Operator My responsibilities include supplying production and post production services to the broadcast industry offering talented and experienced video and audio people that I have worked with and nurtured over my broadcast career, as well as offering my own services as producer, director, shooter and editor. 3/3/11 to 3/10/15---DuArt Vice President of Production/Sales I was brought into this 92-year film-finishing facility/lab to help initiate the metamorphosis from film-oriented post production to video post-production based on my many years in the television/video production/post production industry in Manhattan.  We had 25 rental edit rooms/production offices when I arrived.  We now have 95 rooms...with such tenants/clients as MTV2, Paramount, Lyons Gate Films, NBC Universal/USA Network, Pokemon International and many others. My responsibilities included renting the above rooms to production companies and broadcast/cable networks, managing our HD post production division, developing industry-wide sales strategies, creating production and post production proposals/budgets for broadcast, cable and on-line projects and directing and leading my internal sales team.  My production and post-production background enables me to guide my clients through their projects in the most expeditious manner possible. 1/09/10 to 3/3/11---Broadway Video Vice President of Sales & Marketing: My responsibilities included representing Broadway Video as a ‘full-service’ facility offering traditional video and audio post services (Broadway Sound) and duplication/file transfers/encoding/satellite transmission, QC services, etc. (Broadway Video Digital Media)….while expanding the Broadway brand by starting to offer ‘4-wall’/Avid rental services mailto:onharris7@optonline.net(similar to LA Digital offerings) along with renting production/office space to production companies looking to live in a post environment.  In addition, I have brought in Broadway’s first and recently-completed 3D post project….expanding the brand even further. Some clients I have brought in since January include USA Network, MSG Media, Bellator Fighting Championships, CNBC, New York & Company, Library of American Broadcasting, Nickelodeon International, EPIX HD, Picture Shack Entertainment, Oxygen-NBC Universal, AMC, Rainbow Media and more. 12/09-1/10---LA Digital Post Director of Sales & Marketing: My responsibilities were to rent out the 35-edit room facility in a ‘four-wall’configuration; that is, rent out the editing system (any model Avid or Final Cut PRO) and real estate (editing room itself) to clients who would bring in their own editors for the duration of the project.  Also, I would look to rent out systems off-site when clients wanted to do post in their own office or space.  However, I also established LA Digital’s first finishing post division by hiring the first staff editor/creative director and separate graphics artist to finish projects started in other rented editing rooms in the facility (or off-site, for that matter).  Prior to my arrival, there were any staff members except for s small group of engineers responsible for setting maintaining edit systems on and off-site.   9/2008-12/09---The Napoleon Group, New York, NY Senior Account Executive/Broadcast Sales: My goal was to ‘open up’ the facility/production company to outside broadcast/corporate post production projects for the first time in the company’s existence.  The Napoleon Group has specialized in test commercials (animatics/photomatics) and high-end graphics/animation since its inception in 1979. In addition, I serve as the Executive Producer for all broadcast/corporate clients in house (due to my background as an on-line editor at National Video Center and General Manager at Manhattan Center Studios).

As General Manager, I upgraded the Avid Unity media storage system to enable HD storage, increased and made more versatile the post work-flow between editing rooms and upgraded the Avid Symphony to an uncompressed HD Symphony Nitris.  I also upgraded the Avid Adrenaline and Avid Media Composer suites to enable compressed HD post, aswell. In addition, I added a PRO Tools mixing room as an additional seat on the Unity system and introduced a Final Cut editing system to our graphic division (which included AfterEffects, Combustion and 3-D Maya). I introduced Satellite Media Tours to our television studio division, enabling MCS to take full advantage of its satellite transmission connectivity to Ascent and Waterfront and to enable our insert studio with robotic camera, roof camera, teleprompter and green screen to serve as the perfect vehicle for a New York-based media tour.   I also brought in broadcast shoots such as talk shows, commercials, music  videos and corporate videos to both our ad-hoc television studios, TV2 and TV3. I offered the opportunity for independent filmmakers to use our production and post production facilities to shoot their films, to house their production staffs and to rough-cut, conform and color-correct in a totally uncompressed HD environment.  In 2007, three independent films were being produced and post-produced in the facility. 1/2005-3/2006—Sleeveless Productions, New York, NY Executive V.P., Sales & Marketing: My task was to take a small (3000sq. ft.), high-end boutique with a very small client base through its expansion into a more formidable (9000  sq. ft.) facility…all the while specializing in Smoke, Flame and branding/graphic design packages.
