I'm a dedicated and organized marketer who highly values creativity, autonomy, communication, as well as teamwork. 2 years of experience in social media management revealed a passion for marketing, and introduced me to the fast-paced environment of a digital agency.

I’ve completed several projects for Royale Marketing itself, Elsie Rooftop, W New York Times Square, PHD Rooftop at Dream Hotel Downtown, Elsie Rooftop, SLATE NY, Clinton Hall, and rftp Brooklyn. Primary skills include digital content creation, copywriting, strategy development, account management, client communication, public relations, email marketing, event planning, influencer marketing, paid social media marketing, SEO, social listening, community management, and digital analytics (social media, e-mail, and web).
