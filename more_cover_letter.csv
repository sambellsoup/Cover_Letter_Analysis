2,Castle  Adams,"Castle Adams220 S Greenwood Avenue, Easton, PA 18045 | (310) 938-9415 | castle.adams1@gmail.comTo whom it may concern:I am writing this letter to express my interest in the position you have listed. As you will see in the resume I will have attached with this application, I have been involved in customer service roles since the age of nine. I am passionate about interacting with others and seeing to their experience being a positive one, regardless of the setting. I began with inspiring respect toward aquatic life through tours and presentations at the Aquarium of the Pacific, having been the first education volunteer under the age of 21, which began a shift in volunteer programs at the facility to allow families and teens to become more involved. I later became involved in sales at various businesses, which allowed me to further exercise customer service and problem resolution.Most recently, I was a police dispatcher at the Public Safety Department of a private college. Having worked every shift for an extended period of time in the 24-hour operation, I was exposed to dramatically differing challenges based on the time of day. I developed the skills to handle these challenges with quality and efficiency, from extremely high volume customer service during the day and often high-stress situations in the evening, involving emergency services and communication between all other departments and very frequently other public safety resources. I feel that the responsibilities involved in this role match the capabilities I have refined through prior positions, and I believe this would be an excellent opportunity for me to continue to challenge myself and provide value, both to this work environment and to its clients. I find fulfillment from providing outstanding service to others, through assisting in the resolution of their problems and in de-escalation of high stress situations. Thank you for your consideration regarding this opportunity, and I hope to hear from you soon.Best regards,Castle AdamsPage 2"

Padilla Hempstead, NY 11550  |  (626) 393-2885  |  maurice.padilla94@gmail.com https://www.linkedin.com/in/maurice-padilla-992bb589/ June 19, 2020  Human Resources/Recruiting Team Rookieplay New York, NY    Dear Recruiting Official:  In my eight years of working, I have gained experience in human resources, compliance, hospitality and customer relations. Now, I am again searching to expand my work portfolio and develop my skillset in new industries. This drew my attention to your job posting for Administrative Assistant at Rookieplay. After reviewing the job responsibilities, it excites me to see the vital role this position has within your company and would appreciate the opportunity to contribute my work ethic to this company. My time in hospitality industry and business sector has enhanced my development in both my organization ability, as well as, my communication skillset to maximize my performance as your Rookieplay.  My most successful accomplishment as a human resources assistant was serving as a lead coordinator for a new company contract on-boarding approximately 100 employees. As lead, I participated in the hiring interviews, processing paperwork for both company records and airport badging. The most critical role of serving as lead was developing a comprehensive excel that thoroughly kept track of what each employee completed and need to complete (in the aviation industry the duration of the hiring process is anywhere from 1-3 months with multiple steps of on-boarding). The excel needs to be updated once in the morning and once at night which meant continuously contacting applicants almost daily to provide our work team and client with the most accurate information for all deadlines. As a compliance coordinator, meeting strict deadlines set by the company, airports and state governments to ensure all employees were working in compliant with all regulations. Without a valid license, neither the company nor an individual would be able to allowed to work or provide their services. As a coordinator, it is my responsibility to ensure licenses never expire to maintain the fluidity of the company’s operations. In respect to company agents, resolving any discrepancies that prevented license renewals would also be a part of my daily tasks. This job experience has enhanced my overall attention to time-sensitive matters and executing all tasks with sufficient time to guarantee their completion.  During my time in working at the Ritz-Carlton, Santa Barbara it was my sole responsibility to cater to each guest with Forbes Travel Guide customer service in order to deliver a unique and memorable experience. In order to execute Forbes quality service, I was required to always anticipate the guest’s needs. For example, when I would prepare itineraries, I would have consider forms of transportations to and from destinations, activities that paired well with the guest’s preferences and provide additional outings or recommendations that would maximize their time during their stay. Furthermore, my constant objective for each guest meant arranging their entire calendar with the least amount of effort on their end in order to simplify, but at the same time, amplify their stay.  It has been my pleasure to apply to be your office assistant and I would like to thank you for your time. As presented in this cover letter and my resume, it is my best belief that my qualifications would allow me to excel well in position you are filling. I look forward to arranging a future meeting to discuss possible employment with Rookieplay Sincerely,  Maurice Padilla  (626) 393-2885  "
